Some of the funtions that are needed are only in R so I'm going to try to use R instead 


Importing Packages
```r
library(clusgap)
library(kproto) 
```

Loading the Data
```r
# set the correct file Path
setwd("C:\Users\jdrel\OneDrive\Documents\Data_Science\Springboard\Capstone-2")

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("./data/interim/X_scaled.csv")
```
