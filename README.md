# Abstract 
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely used to protect private and public organizations 
from malicious hacks. There are two capacities that an IDS should have, the first is to find 
blindspots in the network that could precipitate an attack, while the second is to build a model 
that could predict when an intrusion is happening. In 1998, the DARPA Intrusion Detection 
Program created one of the few publicly available datasets that has enough information to build 
an IDS. The purpose of this project was to build an effective IDS from the DARPA dataset. I 
accomplished the first part of an IDS by clustering the observations and analyzing the likelihood 
that a given cluster would hold an attack. For the predictive part, I built both a Neural Network 
model and a Random Forest classifier that performed significantly better than a trivial classifier. 
However there were still some intrusions such as snmp attacks that the model was unable to 
identify. I tried to come up with new ideas for how to detect these intrusion types but my 
attempts were unsuccessful and so it still remains an open question.
